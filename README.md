- 🐱🖐 Hi, I’m Meowton.
- 💻👀 I’m interested in programming, web development, coffee. ☕️
- 🌱🎓 I’m currently learning Node, MySQL, Less\Scss, Git, Docker, Web protocols, PHP, TypeScript, ES6+, Advanced (HTML, CSS, JS) tricks and deep stuff, 
  some frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, Laravel. And English of course. 🦥 
- ⭐️🦐 My goal is to become a junior front-end or full-stack developer in next couple years.
- 📝 Right now I consider myself as half-intern and half-noobie.. 🥺 but I'll keep learning and become a good programmer one day.
